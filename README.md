#What is AmpedMarket
AmpedMarket is an open source project forked from BitWasp which aims to allow people to quickly set up . AmpedMarket is designed to be run as a Tor hidden service. As such it is developed with security and anonymity in mind. 

This project is still in its very early stages. It is essentially BitWasp until it has been thoroughly document and verified, at which point changes will be made. Minor patches to existing components will be pushed back to BitWasp, however new/highly modified components will remain unique to this project (others can use the code in their own software if they wish). 

Use the wiki on github if you want to get involved in the development, or send an email to amphetamine@tormail.org

#Installation and Configuration (At this stage identical to BitWasp)
To set up AmpedMarket, first make ./application/config and ./assets/images writable.

chmod 777 ./application/config
chmod 777 -R ./assets/images

And then visit the installer page to set up the marketplace.
